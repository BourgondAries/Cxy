	The data is placed into slots, imagine this comes in sequence to insertCharacter
	`ab//cd':

		[,]   \
		[a,]  a
		[a,b] b
		[/,b] /
		[/,/] /
		[c,/] c
		[c,d] d

	The CommentBuffer holds this. The CommentIgnorer holds state.
	Note how the CommentIgnorer returns a number. 1 means `take the character that
	was just sent in'.
	2 means `take the previous character, and the current one'.

	When is 2 needed? Imagine

	[/, ]

	We can not know for sure if this will be a `/*' comment, so in this case the CommentIgnorer
	returns 0, which means that it has not decided to take anything out yet. When a non
	star comes around, it can safely take out two elements. If it is another slash,
	then the state of the CommentIgnorer will return 0 until a newline. If the next
	symbol is a star, the CommentIgnorer will go into a block-comment mode.
	This code is rather cryptic, so I should move it to a class.

	filter.push(char);
