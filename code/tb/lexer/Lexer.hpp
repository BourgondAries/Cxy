/**
  This class has as a task to create tokens from character data. It processes
  one character per call (using insertCharacter) and pushes it through
  various stages. This may or may not update the token stack. This stack
  (or rather, vector), may be extracted afterwards in order to process it
  somewhere else. The good news is that extracting the token stack can be
  done via std::move or std::swap, such that this class easily becomes
  a component in a multithreaded environment:
    Thread one: process 10 mb of characters
    Thread two: wait, then process ~1 million characters
    Thread one: fetches another 10 mb of characters and works on that.
    Thread two: keeps processing the tokens.
