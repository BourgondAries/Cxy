      Implement a table-based mealy machine.
      The table is given as an array of Compound.
      This array is only in one dimension, but will be spliced into pieces by
      the "argument size" parameter that's given to transist .

      The table is to be constructed like the following example:
      const tul::Mealy<int, Action, EntryType>::Compound table[]
      {
          {1, push},            {2, push},            {3, push},             {0, transfer},
          {1, push},            {1, push},            {0, transferWord},     {0, transferWord},
          {0, transferInteger}, {2, push},            {0, transferInteger},  {0, transferInteger},
          {3, push},            {3, push},            {4, nothing},          {3, push},
          {0, transferString},  {0, transferString},  {3, push},             {0, transferString},
      };

      Where Action and EntryType are enumerable items.
      The next invocation on transist will be:
      EntryType t;
      transist(t, 4);
