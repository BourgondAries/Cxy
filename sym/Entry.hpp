		How do we do semantic checking?
		For each module, we register a new name.

		Each module has an array of members.
		Each module has an array of grants.
		Each module has an array of aliases.

		Okay, what's next? Well, we need to store the member types.
		We can start by constructing the simplest table:
		[[name, type],..]
		What about functions?
		[[name, type, statements],..]

		What about grants?
		[[ClassName, grantlist],..]

		And alias:
		[[to, from],..]

		Okay, we now have this information. How do we split up the functions for static
		checking?
		Well, we can - after having segmented the module - run the checker on each function.
		How does this work? For each function, go over the list of statements. Use expression
		S-attribution to find out if types match.
