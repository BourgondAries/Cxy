/*

Again, the `<<` operator is used. This time, instead of sending in a string, we send
in a `stream`. `sml.In` is a class that represents the 'standard input' of a program.
From here, we can enter input from the keyboard, or from a pipe.

In the next iteration, we'll look at how we can actually store and use the input from
`sml.In`.
