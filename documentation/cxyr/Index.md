## The Rationale ##
For the entirety of the rationale, the language will be developed from its entry point
to its most precise detail. Each normal line of text has a nominal length of 80 characters.
Words are only broken after a breach of the 80 character limit. The reason for this
is that this allows words with a length of 80+ characters to actually be valid text.

## Version ##
Semantic Versioning is applied.

# General Note #
Any point in the topic may be interjected with the "tangent"s. Tangents refer to another
topic in order to clarify what is later used in the current topic.

The format of a rationale-entry is:
* Description - A short description of the issue that needs to be resolved.
* Discussion - A discussion of potential solutions.
* Conclusion - A subset of the discussion is presented as the solution.

An additional entry called the "tangent" may be added. This is placed such that it
resolves any unknown dependencies of the conclusion or discussion of the problem.
It can be peppered in anywhere. The following list is an index over all rationales.
