a an entry point.

## Version 0.1.0-draft.1 ##
Second recursive macro processor refactored
While the draft.1 and draft.0 versions were important, they were mainly alpha testing
of language functionality such as a parser, lexer, etc. These languages are completely
different from version draft.2 and up, and are in different repositories. They are
not worthy of much notice here, as all that is the same is the name.

## Version 0.1.0-draft.0 ##
Initial recursive macro processor
