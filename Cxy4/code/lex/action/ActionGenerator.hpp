	The action generator receives character types. Based on this information,
	it advances a state machine (a mealy machine) and returns the action that
	the edge of the transition is annotated with.

	For example, on the input:
	aa b c
	it will first say "push, push, transfer" on 'aa ' (note the space). This
	means that a lexeme storage is allocated for each push and the character
	is put onto that storage. The transfer says that the token is finished.

	This class solely concerns itself with providing information about what
	action to take.
